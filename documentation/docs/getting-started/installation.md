# Installation
## About
Hyper Species is a powerful plugin that brings custom spells, species, weapons, abilities and a variety of fantasy
and role-play features into Minecraft. The plugin is currently available and supported for the following software:

- Bukkit
- Spigot
- Paper

??? warning "Other Software"

    Hyper Species may work on other software as well, but we will not provide official support and fixes for these
    versions.

The plugin needs to run on **Minecraft 1.20.x** or later. HyperSpecies uses a lot of new particles, items and sounds
from the newer versions. Older Minecraft versions would make the plugin boring and spells would lose variety.

## How To Install

### Manually <small>Recommended</small> { #manually data-toc-label="Manually" }

Hyper Species is currently published on [Modrinth] and [CurseForge]. You can follow this step-by-step list
to install Hyper Species onto your server.

1. Download Hyper Species from any of the sites mentioned above. You can select any version that fulfills your
   needs.
2. The downloaded `HyperSpecies-V1.x.x.jar` file is now downloaded. Move that file into the `/plugins` directory
   of your server directory.
3. You can now either **reload** your server, by typing `/reload confirm` in the console. Or you can restart the
   server completely.
4. Done! You can now use the plugin. Check the [configuration guide] on how to proceed.

??? info "Server Reloads"

    We recommend to **always** restart the server completely, to avoid bugs. Normally, a reload will do the job,
    but we highly advice against it, especially if there are more than 10 players online.
